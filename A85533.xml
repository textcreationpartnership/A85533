            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Earth and Sea, compoſed themſelves in a Sphericall figure, and is cauſed by the proper inclination of each part, which being heavy falls from every poynt of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and claps about the center, there ſettles as near as it may towards his place of reſt: we may illuſtrate both the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ſcituation by a familiar ſimilitude to an ingenious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; Suppoſe we a knot to be knit in the midſt of a Cord that hath many ends, and thoſe to be delivered to ſundry men of equall ſtrength to be drawn ſeverall wayes round from every part above, and below, and on each ſide.</p>
               <p>Queſtioneleſſe while every man draws in the boes of the knots, it muſt needs become round, and whilſt they continue to pluck with equall ſtrength it muſt reſt immoveable in the middle betwixt them, ſince every ſtrength that would deſtroy, hath a ſtrength equall to reſiſt it; ſo it is in the boſome of the earth where every part wheeles upon equall priviledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor can any preſſe farther then the center to deſtroy this compacted figure, for it muſt meet there with a body that will oppoſe it, or if not, yet could it not paſſe, ſince every motion from the middle were to aſcend, which nature will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in a body of weight as the whole earth is.</p>
               <p>The compaſſe of the whole is caſt by our lateſt and moſt learned, to be 21600 Engliſh miles, which though none ever yet ſo pared as to meaſure them by the foot, yet let not the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant reject this accompt, ſince the rule by which they are led cannot faile: for we ſee by continuall experience, that the Sun for every degree in the Heavens, gaines ſixty miles upon the earth, towards his circuit round, and after three hundred ſixty degrees, returneth to the ſame poynt in reſpect of us as before it was: repeat the number of 60 ſo oft and you will finde the accompt juſt, and ſo by proportion of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the diameter, which is <hi>tripla ſeſqui-ſeptima,</hi> the ſame which 22 hath to 7.

               <head>What a Globe is.</head>
               <p>A Globe we may define to be an Analogicall repreſentation either of the Heavens or of the earth, and we call it Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golicall, not only in regard of its forme, expreſſing the figure of the Heavens, as alſo of the terreſtiall Globe, conſiſting of the earth it ſelfe, together with the interflowing Seas, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that it repreſenteth unto us in a juſt proportion and diſtance each particular conſtellation in the Heavens, and every ſeverall region and tract of ground in the earth, together with certaine circles, both greater and leſſer, invented by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for the more ready computation of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The greater circles we call thoſe which divide the whole, ſuperficies of the Globe into equall parts or halfes and thoſe the leſſer which divide the ſame into two unequall parts.</p>
               <p>Beſides the body of the Globe it ſelfe, there is alſo annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certaine frame, with neceſſary inſtruments thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.</p>
               <p>The Fabrick of the frame is thus; firſt of all there is a baſe or foot to reſt upon, on which, there are raiſed perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix pillars or columnes of equall length and diſtance, upon the top of which there is faſtned to a levell a round plate or circle of wood, which they call the Horizon, becauſe that the uppermoſt ſuperficies thereof performs the office of the true horizon, for it divideth the whole Globe into 2 equal parts; whereof that which was uppermoſt, repreſenteth unto us the viſible Hemiſphere, and the other, that which is hid from us. So likewiſe the circle which divideth that part of the world
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150076:4"/>
which we ſee from the other, which we ſee not is called the Horizon, and that poynt which is directly over our heads in our Hemiſphere, and is on every ſide equadiſtant from the Horizon, is commonly called Zenith, and that poynt which is oppoſite to it in the lower Hemiſphere, is commonly written Nadir theſe two poynts are called alſo the Poles of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, upon the ſuperficies of the Horizon in a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Globe, there are deſcribed firſt, the twelve ſignes of the Zodiack, and each of theſe is divided againe into thirty leſſer portions, ſo that the whole Horizon is divided into 360 parts, which they alſo call degrees, and every degree is divided into ſixty parts, alſo each of them is called a ſcruple or minute, and ſo by the like ſubdiviſion of minutes into ſixty parts will ariſe ſeconds, and of theſe thirds, and likewiſe fourths, and fifths, &amp;c. but the like partition ſtill of each into ſixty parts.</p>
               <p>There is alſo deſcribed upon the Horizon, the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender, and that three ſeverall wayes, to wit, the ancient way, which is ſtill in uſe with us here in England, and the new way appointed by Pope Gregory 23, wherein the Aequinoxes and Solſtice were reſtored to the ſame places they were in at the time of the Celebration of the councell of Nite, and in the third, the ſaid Aequinoctiall and Solſticall points are reſtored to the places they were in, at the time of our Saviour Chriſts nativity.</p>
               <p>The months in the Calender, are divided into dayes and weeks, to which are annexed as their peculiar characters the 7 firſt letters of the Alphabet.</p>
               <p>The innermoſt border of the Horizon, is divided into thirty two parts, according to the number of the winds, which are obſerved by our moderne Sea-faring-men in their Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which alſo we are wont to deſigne forth the quarters of the Heavens, and the Coaſts of Countries, the names of the windes are ſet downe both in Engliſh and Latine, in the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of the materiall Globes.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the Horizon is manifold, Firſt it divides the heavens into 2 Hemiſphears; Secondly it ſhews what ſtars ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet, and what never riſe from under the earth, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what ſtars doe both riſe and ſet; Thirdly, it ſheweth the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150076:5"/>
cauſe of the equality and inequality of the artificiall dayes and nights; Fourthly, it conduceth to the finding out of the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any place; Fifthly, it is the cauſe of the rectitude and obliquity of the Sphear, whereof we have occaſion to ſpeake more largely hereafter.</p>
               <p>There is alſo let into this Horizon two notches, oppoſite one ro the other, a circle of braſſe, making right angles with the ſaid Horizon, and placed ſo that it may be removed at pleaſure up and downe by thoſe notches, as need ſhall require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Circle is called the Meridian becauſe that one ſide of it which is in like manner divided into 360 degrees, ſupplyeth the office of the true Meridian. Now the Meridian is one of greater circles, paſſing through the Poles of the world, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Horizon, to which when the Sun in his daily revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is arrived in the upper Hemiſphere it is mid-day, and when it toucheth the ſame in the lower Hemiſphere it is mid-night at the place whoſe Meridian it is.</p>
               <p>The Meridian (which comes firſt to be conſidered) is a great Circle compaſſing round the Earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you ſee in the circumference of both Planiſphears of the Map, and wherein are written the names of the Zones and Climates, This chiefe, firſt fixed Meridian paſſeth through the Iſlands called Azores, according to the ancient Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and there are two reaſons why they did there begin to reckon the longitude of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that at that time there was no land known further to the Weſterne then that place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Under that Meridian the Needle in the Marriners compaſſe had no variation, but did poynt directly North and South.</p>
               <p>There be alſo many Meridians according to the divers places in which a man lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the number of them equall to ſo many points as may be imagined in the Globe; but the uſuall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them known to view<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is by ten degrees a ſunder; and are thoſe black lines which you ſee in both Planiſpheares, running downe along from the North to the South Pole.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the Meridian, is to ſhew the longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City or Cape, is the diſtance of it Eaſt from the firſt great Meridian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150076:5"/>
is meaſured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian into the Eaſt, and containeth the whole compaſſe of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> 360<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degrees.</p>
               <p>To prove this by example, caſt your eye on <hi>London,</hi> and you ſhall ſee it ſomething to the Eaſt of the ſecond black Meridian: paſſe downe with that black line to the Aequinoctiall, and look as much Eaſt there, as <hi>London</hi> is from that Meridian above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall, from the firſt great Meridian to that place, and that diſtance is the longitude of <hi>London,</hi> which you may perceive to be 20 degrees and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And the like manner of working is to be made for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
               <p>That line full of degrees croſſing both Planiſphears ſtraight along in the middle, and dividing the world into two halfs (<hi>viz.</hi>) North and South halfs; is called the <hi>Aequinoctiall line,</hi> or the Aequator; either becauſe it is of equall diſtance from both Poles of the world, or elſe becauſe the Sun coming in this Circle makes the dayes and nights throughout the world of a length; which happens upon the 10. or 11. of March, and the 13, or 14. of September. It paſſes through <hi>Abaſſia</hi> or <hi>Preſter Johns</hi> Kingdome, and Manicongo in Africa, through the great Iſland Sumatra, and the Maldive Iſles of Africa; and in America, through Guiana.</p>
               <p>The uſe of it is to ſhew the latitude of any Countrey, City, Promontory, or the like: Now the latitude is the diſtance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinoctiall line or middle of the world; and is reckoned and meaſured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Meridian toward either Pole. Thoſe therefore have Northerne latitude that inhabit between the Aequinoctiall and the North Pole, as they have Southerne latitude that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame Equator and the South Pole.</p>
               <p>Thoſe black lines thwa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

thereat; they are 50.) moreover, add to that number of 50. ſo much as London is ſituate above that paralel, the ſpace is one degree and an halfe; thus you ſhall finde the latitude of <hi>London</hi> (that is, the diſtance thereof from the Aequator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North Pole) to be 51 degrees and a halfe: and in like manner muſt the latitude of all other places be ſought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two, the whole earth is reckoned.</p>
               <p>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as alſo the Zodiack, are filled throughout with degrees, the number 360 and every degree conſiſts of 60 minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20 leagues, or 60 miles.</p>
               <p>The great circle that is drawn bending bias in one planiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheare up to the Tropick of Cancer, in the other downe to the Tropick of Capricorne, is the Zodiack; it is repleniſhed with degree, and beares on it the Characters of the twelve ſignes.</p>
               <p>The uſes of it are to ſhew over what Countreyes and people the body and beames of the Sun come perpendicular at ſome times or other in the year, and it ſhewes to all (where the days increaſe and decreaſe) the longeſt and ſhorteſt days of the year, for the Sun (which cauſeth the ſame) being alwayes in this circle and therein moving about one degree a day, all the while he is coming up from the Tropicke of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increaſe in the Northerne Climates: but contrariwiſe in his courſe back from Cancer to Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne they ſhorten to us, and lengthen to thoſe in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Climates; and this Circle ſhews the foure quarters of the yeare; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</p>
               <p>The Tropick of Cancer, (ſo called, or the Caeleſtiall ſigne Cancer) is a circle, whoſe diſtance from the Aequinoctiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, is 23 degrees and a halfe. When the Sun is come ſo far Northward as to touch this Circle, then is our longeſt day in the year.</p>
               <p>It paſſes through the Southermoſt parts of Barbary and Aegypt, Arabia, India, China, <hi>Nova Hiſpania,</hi> and the Iſland Cuba.</p>
               <p>The Tropick of Capricorne, (likewiſe ſo named of the ſigne Capricorne in the ſtarry Heaven) is a circle of like diſtance at

the other Tropick from the Aequinoctiall Southward, that is 23 degrees and a halfe. When the Sun is gone downe to the Circle Southward, it is our ſhorteſt day in the whole year.</p>
               <p>This Tropick paſſes through Monomopata, Saint Laurence Iſland, Peru, and the South coaſts of Braſile.</p>
               <p>The Artick, or North polar Circle, is diſtant from the North Pole, 23 degrees and a halfe; ſo much as the Tropick of Cancer from the Aequinoctiall; but the diſtance between that Tropick and it, is 43 degrees.</p>

               <p>Now theſe four leſſer circles, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the two Tropicks, and Polar circles, doe fitly part the Earth into five Zones.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Zones.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Zone</hi> is a ſpace of Earth, contained between two of the ſmaller circles, or within the compaſſe of either Polar Circle: the name ſignifies as much as a girdle, by reaſon that each Zone compaſſeth about the Earth in manner of a girdle. Of theſe there be two kinds, one temperate, the other untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
               <p>There be two temperate Zones; the one North, the other South.</p>
               <p>The North temperate Zone is that ſpace of earth contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned between the Tropick of Cancer, and the North Polar Circle.</p>
               <p>The South temperate Zone is that ſpace of earth ſtretched along between the Tropick of Capricorne, and the South Polar Circle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:150076:7"/>They are called temperate Zones, for that the aire thereof hath a far better and more moderate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, then the untemperate Zones. The breadth of them is forty three degrees a piece, which degrees make either temperate Zone to be 2580 Engliſh miles broad a piece.</p>
               <p>The untemperate Zones are twofold; one exceeding in the extremity of heat, the other as much in cold; they have been thought in former times altogether unhabitable, but latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath found them more fit for habitation,</p>
               <p>The Torrid or burnt Zone (which is the hot untemperate Zone) is that ſpace of Heaven which you ſee contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropick of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of Torrid, becauſe the Sun continually paſſes thereo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and caſting down direct rayes, affects it with a marvellous heat; thereby making it not ſo inconvenient for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as the temperate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended between the two Tropicks, and containes 47 degrees, that is of Engliſh miles 2820.</p>
               <p>The frozen Zones are ſpaces of Earth incloſed within either of the Polar Circles: of theſe there are two, one North, the other South.</p>
               <p>The North frozen Zone, is that ſpace of Earth contained within the compaſſe of the North Polar Circle. The breadth thereof reckoned twenty three degrees and a halfe, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Pole it ſelfe to the Polar Circle, which of Engliſh miles is 1410.</p>
               <p>The South frozen Zone, is that ſpace of Earth compaſſed all about with the South Polar Circle: It hath the like breadth from the South Pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North Pole: and likewiſe the number of miles is the ſame.</p>
               <p>They are called frozen Zones, becauſe they (for the moſt part) exceed in cold; and that is cauſed in regard that the Sunne for a good part of the year, is under the Horizon, and ſees them not; and when he is come up into their ſight, his appearance which (for a pretty long ſeaſon together) rather comforts them, then any vertuall heat proceeding from him; for there the Aire is ſtuft with thick foggy vapours, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150076:7"/>
his beames at higheſt fall but very obliquely on them; ſo that what through his want and unability to diſpel the cold and the colds force to reſiſt, and beare back the Suns heat; theſe Zones remaine almoſt unhabitable, and even (as the word is) frozen.</p>
               <p>The names of all theſe, ſet in the right place of each Zone you ſhall ſee in that Meridian going about America and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanica</p>

               <head>Of the Climates.</head>
               <p>IN that great Meridian going about Europe, Aſia, and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, are deſcribed the Climates; Now a Climate is a ſpace of the Earth included within the ſpace of two Parellels. The uſe of them is to ſhew the difference of length and ſhortneſſe of dayes over all the world, as you may ſee in the midſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Climate, ſet the number of the houres of the longeſt day in the yeare, under that Climate: the longeſt day in one Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, differing halfe an houre from the longeſt in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that there are four and twenty Climates, conſiſting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be twenty foure hours in length, which is twelve houres longer then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be underſtood; Under the Aequinoctiall line, and thirteen degrees, that is, three Parallels, on either ſide thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelve houres, but after in every Clime increaſe the length of halfe an houre, ſo that there are numbred (as is ſaid before) 48 Parellels, which make twenty four Climates, before the dayes become twenty foure houres long, the which length they being grown to, their increaſe is then by whole weeks and months, till in the four and twentieth Clime: about the Pole, the day is full halfe a year long. And it is thus between the Aequator and the North Pole, ſo it is between the ſaid Aequator and South Pole: wherefore there are 2 ſorts of Climes, that is 24 Northerne, and as many Southerne.

That there be but nine named; the reaſon is, becauſe when theſe names were given, no more then nine Climates were known to thoſe of ancient times; but ſince, though the number of them be increaſed to twenty foure, the reſt are not knowne by proper names, but remaine innomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>In the two oppoſite points of this Meridian are faſtned the two ends of an iron pin, paſſing through the body of the Globe and its centre, one of which ends is called the Artick, or North pole of the world; and the other the Antartick or South Pole; and the pin it ſelfe is called the Axis; for the Axis of the world is the Diameter about which it is turned, and the extreame ends of the Axis are called the Poles.</p>
               <p>To either of theſe Poles when need ſhall require there is a certaine braſſe Circle or ring to be faſtned; which Circle is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into twenty four equall parts, according to the number of the hours day and night, and it is therefore called the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, and this Circle is to be applied to either of the Poles in ſuch ſort as that the ſection where twelve is deſcribed may preciſely agree with the points of mid-day and mid-night in the ſuperficies of the true Meridian.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another little pinne to be faſtned to the end of the Axis, in the very Center of the hour circle; this pin is ſo made as it turnes about and poynteth to every of the twenty four ſections in the hour-circle, according as the Globe it ſelfe is moved about, ſo that you may place the point of it to what houre you pleaſe.</p>

and the Index to that 12 houres which is uppermoſt, and ſo having thus done you muſt turne the Globe about till the degree wherein the Sun is come to the Eaſterne ſide of the Horizon; which done the Index will poynt out the houre of his riſing, and if you turne it about to the Weſt ſide, you ſhall in like manner have the houre of his ſetting.</p>
               <p>There is alſo belonging to the Meridian, a quadrant of Altitude, being made of a long thin plate, of ſteel or braſſe, and faſhioned crooked, ſo that it may be applyed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexe ſuperficies of the Globe.</p>

               <p>THe firſt whereof is concerning the poſition of the Globe, and the other Climates.

When you have thus placed your Globe ſo that it may be turned any way at pleaſure, yet ſo that the baſe or foot be not moved out of its place. The next thing that is to be inquired after, is the latitude of the place wherein you live, which according as it is greater or leſſe, you muſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Pole of your Globe above the Horizon proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. As for example, if the latitude be 50, 51, or 52. grad. or more or leſſe Northward, then muſt you elevate the Artick Pole, juſt ſo many degrees above the Horizon, and ſo likewiſe if the latitude be Southerne, you muſt doe the like by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick or South Pole, But under the Aequator where there is no latitude at all both the Poles muſt be placed in the very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon at oppoſite points.</p>
               <p>Now if you deſire to know the longitude of any place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Globe, you muſt apply the ſame place to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and obſerving at what place the Meridian cutteth the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, reckon the degree of the Aequator from the Meridian of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Iſland to that place; for ſo many are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of longitude of the place you look for.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner you may meaſure the difference of longitude betwixt any other two places that are deſcribed in the Globes.</p>
               <p>Now if you deſire to finde the latitude of any place expreſſed in the Globe, you muſt apply the ſame to the Meridian, and reckon the number of the degrees that it is diſtant from the Aequator, for ſo much is the latitude of that place.</p>
               <p>To finde the diſtance of two places, ſet your Globe in ſuch ſort, as that the Zenith of one of the plates be 90 degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150076:10"/>
every way from the Horizon, and then faſten the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of altitude to the verticall point and ſo move it up and downe untill it paſſe through the vertix of the other place, the number of the degrees intercepted in the Quadrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two places, being reſolved into furlongs, miles or leagues, as you pleaſe, will ſhew you the true diſtance of the places aſſigned, and the other end of the Quadrant that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Horizon will ſhew on what winde or quarter of the world the one place is in reſpect of the other, or what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or poſition it hath, for the angle or poſition is that which is comprehended betwixt the Meridian of any place, and a great Circle paſſing through the Zeniths of any two places aſſigned, and the quantity of it is to be numbred in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <p>As for example, The longitude of London is 26 degrees and it hath in Northerne latitude 51 degrees and a halfe. Now it is demanded, what diſtance and angle of poſition it beareth to Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Iſland, which is one of the Azores; we muſt proceed thus to finde it; firſt, let the North Pole be Elevated 51 degrees which is the latitude of London, then faſtning the Quadrant of altitude to the Zenith of it, that is to ſay 51 degrees and an halfe Northward from the Aequator; we muſt turne it about till it paſſe through Saint Michaels Iſland, and we ſhall finde the diſtance intercepted betwixt theſe 2 places to be 11 degrees, 40. m. or thereabouts, which is 280 of our leagues, and if we obſerve in what part of the Horizon the end of the Quadrant reſteth we ſhall finde the angle of poſition to fall neer upon 50 gr. betwixt South-weſt and by weſt, and this is the Scituation of this Iſland in reſpect of London. The diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of places differing only in latitude may be found out after this manner; Firſt, you muſt ſubſtract the leſſer latitude from the greater, reſolving a degree into minutes, if the ſubſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be done otherwiſe convenienty; then multiply the degrees by 15, and divide the minutes by 4. and the ſum produced will be the diſtance of thoſe two places in common Germane miles, one whereof containeth four of our Engliſh miles.</p>

are into 360 parts and it will not be amiſſe to ſub-divide each of theſe into leſſer parts if it may be conveniently done. And now it only remaines to finde out the diſtances of the hour lines in this Circle, for any latitude of place, which that we may doe by the uſe of the Globe, let it firſt be ſet to the Latitude of the place aſſigned, and then make choice of ſome of the greater Circles in the Globe that paſſe through the Poles of the world. As for example, The Aequinoctiall colour if you pleaſe, and apply the ſame to the Meridian, in which ſcituation it ſheweth the mid-day, or 12 a Clock, then turning about the Globe toward the Weſt (if you will) till that 15 degrees of the Aequator have paſſed through the Meridian: you muſt marke the degree of the Horizon, that the ſame colour croſſeth in the Horizon, for that point will ſhew the diſtance of the firſt and <hi>11th</hi> houres from the Meridian both of which are diſtant an houres ſpace from the Meridian, or line of Mid-day; then turning againe the Globe forward till other fifteen degrees are paſt the Meridian, the ſame Colour, will point out the diſtance of the <hi>10th</hi> hour, which is 2 hours before noon, and of the ſecond houre after noon; and in the ſame manner may you find out the diſtances of all the reſt in the Horizon, allotting to each of them 15 degrees in the Aequator, croſſing the Meridian; but here you muſt take notice by the way, that the beginning of this account of the diſtances, muſt be taken from that part of the Horizon on which the Pole is elevated, to wit, from the North-part of the Horizon, if the Artick Pole be elevate, and ſo likewiſe from the South part, if the Antartick be elevated.</p>
               <p>The diſtances of the houres being thus noted in the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of the Globe, you muſt afterward tranſlate them into your plaine allotted for your dyal ground, reckoning in the circumference of it ſo many degrees to each houre as are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe pointed out by the Colour in the Horizon; and laſtly, having thus done the Gnomon or Stile muſt be erected, where you are to obſerve this one thing, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the chiefe thing to be carefully looked unto, namely, that that edge or line of the Gnomon, which is to ſhew the hours by its ſhadow in all kinds of Dials muſt be ſet parallel to the Axis of the world, that ſo it may make an angle of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150076:15"/>
with its plain ground equall to that which the Axis of the world makes with the Horizon, now that the ſtile is to ſtand directly to the North and South, or the Meridian line is a thing commonly knowne.</p>
               <p>Now if you would make a plaine erect dyall perpendicular to the Horizon, which is commonly called a <hi>Murall,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting either the Norrh or South, you muſt remember this one thing, that that which is an erect dyall in one place wil be a horizontall in another, whoſe Zenith is diſtant from that place 90 degrees either Northward or Southward.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe by this rule may be made any manner of inclining dyall, if ſo be that the quantity of the inclination be but knowne, as for example, if a dyall be made on a plaine ground, whoſe inclination is ten degrees from the Horizon Southward, and for a place whoſe latitude is for 52 gr. North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you muſt deſcribe it in that plaine and horizontall diall for the latitude of 62 degrees North-ward, and if in the ſame Latitude the diall ground doe incline toward the North 16 gr. you muſt take an horizonticall dial for the Northerne lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 36 gr.</p>
               <trailer>And thus much for making dials by the Globe.</trailer>
